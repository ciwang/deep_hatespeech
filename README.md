# Classifying hate speech with deep learning

Research in progress for an independent Stanford honors thesis in computer science, advised by Chris Potts. We present a neural network classifier for hate speech, augmented by semantic information from [Hatebase](https://www.hatebase.org "Hatebase.org").

Data from ["Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language", ICWSM 2017](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language).
